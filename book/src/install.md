# Installing Helix

There are 3 primary ways to install Helix:

1. Download a [pre-built binary from GitHub](./prebuilt-binaries.md).
2. Install Helix via [your operating system's package manager](./package-managers.md).
3. [Build Helix from source](./building-from-source.md).


> ðŸ’¡ To get the latest nightly version of Helix, you need to
  [build from source](./building-from-source.md).

> ðŸ’¡ To take full advantage of Helix's built-in LSP support, you need to install the language servers for your preferred programming languages alongside Helix. Refer to [Language Support](TODO) to see which languages have pre-configured support, and refer to [Language Server Configurations](TODO) for instructions on installing the LSP for one of these pre-configured languages.
